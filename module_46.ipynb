    "2. **Standard deviation (σ):** The standard deviation measures the spread or dispersion of the data. A larger standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values, leading to a flatter and wider distribution. Conversely, a smaller standard deviation results in a narrower and taller distribution.\n",
